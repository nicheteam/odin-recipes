    <h3>Descriprion</h3>

    <p>They're portable, sort of like a mini pizza, except shaped like a cupcake. They're a great savory snack and a
        great addition to a game day buffet. Feel free to customize to your family's tastes with additions like ham,
        sausage, bell peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, etc. I recommend not omitting the tomato, that
        really adds something special.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 medium cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (11 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce (such as Classico®)</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons finely chopped red onion</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices pepperoni, quartered</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning to taste</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes to taste</li>
        <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8 cups of a muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Finely chop cherry tomatoes and drain any liquid. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Unroll pizza crust on a floured work surface and roll out thinly into a large rectangle. Using a 4-inch
            round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut 8 circles in the dough. Place dough circles in the prepared muffin cups,
            pressing dough into the bottom and up the sides of each cup.</li>
        <li>Drop 1 teaspoon mozzarella into each cup. Top with 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce. Add chopped tomatoes and red
            onions. Add 1 tablespoon of mozzarella to each cup, and top with pepperoni. Sprinkle each cup with Italian
            seasoning, red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, 14 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and
            let cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Remove from the tin and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
